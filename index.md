Are you ready to defy gravity and master the art of the perfect handstand? Meet your instructor, Jane. She was once just like you, struggling with anxiety and self-esteem. "I used to think that I wasn't strong or athletic enough to do a handstand," Jane admits. "I would always compare myself to others and feel like I wasn't good enough."
